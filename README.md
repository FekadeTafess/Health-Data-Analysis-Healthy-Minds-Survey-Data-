# Health-Data-Analysis-Healthy-Minds-Survey-Data-
I conducted an analysis of the Healthy Minds Survey data from the University of Michigan (and other U.S. universities), examining the correlation between financial stressors and mental health among college students during the 2024–2025 academic year. I used this analysis for an Externship program to gain and adapt my skills in data analysis performance.
My research question: Are higher levels of current financial stress, food insecurity and housing instability associated with increased depression and anxiety among U.S college students?
